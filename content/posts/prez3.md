On  February 12th and 13th, 2000 the Alaska and Prez were the guests of the Northern Lights Model Railroad Club's Alaska Northern RR where it participated in the Fur Rondy operations.  As so often happens, the Prez embarrassed the CSWRR with his antics.  Later on the 13th, the Alaska was interchanged to the Military Society of Model Railroad Engineers, North Star Railroad operation at the Alaska Railroad Depot, Fur Rondy display.

The [Side Story](/posts/feb_2000_incident) of the Prez's antics starting on February 15th and continuing into March.  These stories are impromptu and carried on by e-mail by usually a hand full of participants with vivid imaginations.  Someone starts the ball rolling and others jump in and simply add to it.  Then around and around it goes.  These Stories are great fun and I would like to share this one with you.

On the morning of February 14th, the Alaska with Prez was found to be guarded by a military guard.  It was later determined that he was in a conference with General Don Sherwood who the Prez was giving instructions on the finer arts of handling Monicas.  On the following day, the Alaska and Prez were checking out one of the new Alaska Railroad SD70MAC's, 4002.  On Wednesday, the Prez met with Alaska Railroad President, Bill Sheffield to discuss the operations of their railroads.  On Friday, February 18th, 2000, after a hard week of Rondy operation, a tired Prez and Alaska returned to home rails for some much needed rest.  Later that evening, after the CSWRR crews had spotted the Alaska in it's roundhouse stall, the Prez was seen heading for Dr. Cookoo's.
