Our special today is powered by ALCO PA2/PB2, Santa Fe Number 75.  As the departure time nears, our engineer confers with Senior Track Inspector; Otto Gage who assures us the track ahead is in excellent condition.  At exactly 11 AM, Engineer Willey brings the ALCOs to life and he slowly eases out on the main heading west.

While the guests are enjoying lunch, the special will travel to Porphyry, turn and be ready to start the Executive Tour heading east. 

As we finish lunch, our special is being turned and we move to the rear observation platform to enjoy our tour of the CSWRR.  The CEO directs our attention to Porphyry and the May Industrial Park where several shippers are located.  Above we see Corona Citrus and Riverside County Feed and Seed which are significant revenue sources for the CSWRR.

Approaching Highgrove, our train slows as we pass Mama Joe’s place.  Often Mama Joe will greet passenger trains banging a couple of pans together, protesting the railroad’s killing one of her chickens about 23 years ago.  As we were not a scheduled train, she was not expecting our passing.

```

With the PA/PB ALCOS and only two cars our Special has no problem with the 3% grade on the West side of the pass.  The Dispatcher is asking if we could use the South Track Cajon to Summit.  To which the CEO clearly states NO.  The DS then informs the CEO that he will have to put us on the South to get a coal train by us at Cajon, the CEO agrees, but again states that he wants the North track out of Cajon.

```

As our special crosses over to the South track at Cajon we meet the Rio Grande 5378 West with a loaded Coal Train heading down grade.  The coal train is actually a CSWRR train, having been turned over to the CSWRR at Batstow

At Cajon we observe the Lime Plant.  The CEO tells us that the Lime Plant is a good source of revenue for the CSWRR as lime is shipped from here to the Cement Plant at Colton.

As we continue eastward up the 3% grade, the lovely hostess again directs us to the dining table where dinner is being served.  On the menu this evening is filet mignon once again by the renowned Chef Edward Coli.  As you are being seated, our special is crossing Cajon Creek, passing Mormon Rocks and will soon crest the summit of Cajon Pass to head out across the Mojave Desert.
