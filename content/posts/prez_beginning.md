## How it all Started

The car was sold by Walthers as an Oscar and originally owned by the late Ed Laux where for many years it entertained the Laux children and grandchildren.  In October of 1996, the Consolidated South Western Railroad (CSWRR) acquired the car as a basket case, from the Ed Laux estate.  Early in 1997, it was rebuilt, assigned the designation of RR-1 and for the next year used for special celebrity tours during operating sessions.  Then in March of 1998, it was again upgraded  with the designation of Alaska and assigned as the private business car of the CSWRR, Prez.  The car is now assigned to the travels of the Prez for which it is well suited, as the barge tariff is based on car length.  Hosting CEO's and Prez's are asked to add/provide the information of the Alaska's visit.

The CSWRR is a imaginary Consolidation of the Santa Fe Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad into a representative HO simulation from Barstow to Los Angeles, California.  The railroad relives 1985 with 350 feet of double track main line, on 3  levels with a flavor of Southern California and features Cajon Pass.  The CSWRR is located in a 30 by 40 foot basement near Palmer, Alaska and hosts an operation session on the second Saturday evening of each month.  Visitors are welcome at any time, please call ahead (907) 746-6414, or e-mail cswrrceo@mtaonline.net.

On July 13, 1998, Alaska departed by barge to Ted York's, Cajon Pass in Alpine Utah for a UPHS open house and a golden spike ceremony, returning to home rails on August 19, 1998.  

On September 19 and 20th, the Alaska was operated on home rails for the third annual CSWRR Open House.

On November 14, 1998 the Alaska departed via the BBBRR for the Granite Mountain Railroad in Longmont Colorado and returned on April 10, 1999 via the BBBRR.  As yet, no details of this trip have been made available to the CSWRR Management. 

On the evening of April 10, the Alaska was operated on a Boomer Bob Funtime Steam Tour train over the CSWRR.  The special train consisted of 2 coaches, a Party Car with many figures representing visitors and the Alaska.
