## About
An old friend of mine once had a website dedicated to his model railroad and things in his community.

This site was created to upload and keep those stories and information that he had available on the internet.

I have debated for a couple hours on fixing his site from the Internet Archive download that I was able to obtain, or reuploading the work 
in a method that is more commonplace for the current web. As you can tell, I made a decision. 

I will post a link to the last crawl the Internet Archive took of his site for historical reasons, and I also have a backup stored locally.

The biggest part of making this work will be getting the photos. The Archive I was able to get didn't have any of a lot of the photos outside of the 
main page.

## Structure

This is going to be the only page that is written by me. Every other page will have been written by Marty, CEO of the Consolidated South Western Railroad.

If I do have to put in notes, I will put them in a code block.
